# Folder explorer

This program is a simple file explorer that runs in the console. It allows the user to navigate through
folders and files using the keyboard. The user can browse directory contents, move into subfolders, return
to previous directories, and open files in their default applications. The program displays 
a list of files and folders, highlights the currently selected item, and notifies the user if access to a folder is denied. 
It operates in a text-based interface, using console input to handle navigation via the arrow keys, Enter, Esc, and the left arrow key.
